👋 Hello and welcome to the **$40,000 in USDC Kleidi** audit channel!

📆 Audit opens Tuesday, 15 October 2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Friday, 25 October 2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) (10 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the Kleidi team, particularly @elliot and @prat.gp, who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a PRIVATE thread in the CET timezone(s).

🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try after the audit has launched, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

The section about ERC20s is confusing. What should we consider in scope for this audit? The sponsors mentioned 'any (all possible ERC20s)' for the 'ERC20 used by the protocol,' but below that, many ERC20s are listed as out of scope. I assume we should focus on the 'standard' ERC20 tokens and skip the 'weird' ones, but as a suggestion for next time, it would be helpful to make the scope clearer and more concrete.

- Is there a security reason for not allowing overlapping checks? Or is it just a design choice?
- How one checks param 1 AND 3 at the same time?
- Can you please clarify those two statements, are they talking about different delays? 

`This is why it is important to have a longer time delay on the recovery spells than on the timelock.`

`it is of critical importance that the delay is shorter than the timelock delay`

@elliot @prat.gp  Would you like to explain the reason of the following process for recovery spell.
        ///   1). remove all but final existing owner, set owner threshold to 1
        ///   2). swap final existing owner for the first new owner
        ///   3). add the remaining new owners to the safe, with the
        ///   last owner being added updating the threshold to the new value
        ///   4). remove the recovery module from the safe
Especially, what's the purpose of step 2?


[10/23/2024 11:26] .boy2000
safe does not allow removing all owners(threshold must be >= 1). so one of them needs to swapped with another.

The first three questions are the same as I have.


[10/25/2024 10:53] justawanderkid
Just a unnecessary additional logic, it's just how dev wanted to implement it this way.

yes very solid indeed. Alex also reported a bunch of QAs in their previous codebase. I wonder if auditors found legit vulnerabilities in the current codebase.

Can someone clarify why <https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi-validation/issues/81> is invalid. It seems validator did not understand the issue. This C4 system is really something.

Issue was rejected with `no security concern as there could be another schedule with different salt anyway`, while salts have nothing to do with the issue. `timestamps[id] = block.timestamp + delay;` so even if delay is 0, this will still always revert during `execute`.


[11/21/2024 17:51] 0xsorrynotsorry
Hey @Boy2000 ,

I was the validator for this contest and I'm sorry for your experience.

To add, yes, salt does not effect this, I should have commented as this was an inflated submission with delay being configured to uint256.max as well as the mitigation suggests that delay upper bound should be 1000 years without holding any logic.


[11/21/2024 17:54] 0xsorrynotsorry
To sum up, the submission could have been better suited in a QA report but it didn't hold the bar to be an audit report.


[11/21/2024 18:13] .boy2000
Appreciate the comment. I don't agree it's inflated (contract should never end in a state where it will always revert). Alright, peace.

Hello. Can I have a clarification why https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi-validation/issues/196 is not valid?


[11/22/2024 13:42] .boy2000
Seems sponsor disputes <https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi-findings/issues/18>


[11/22/2024 17:58] 0xf40
“.. the new owner shouldn't be the safe itself” it is not the same problem as 196


[11/22/2024 18:10] 0xf40
196 and 205 (https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi-validation/issues/205)  are duplicates. The problem is reusing address in owner list, which can DoS the contract, not setting the safe itself as owner.


[11/22/2024 18:30] justawanderkid
Just move on. Contest has ended.


[11/22/2024 18:58] 0xf40
I got it, but I want to know why it is not valid.
